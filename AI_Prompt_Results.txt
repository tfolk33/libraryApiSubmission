**Prompt**
I am making an API using FastAPI with python. Can you generate route stubs for the following operations. Do not include any code.

The API should support the following operations:

Create a new author
Retrieve a list of all authors
Retrieve a specific author by ID
Update an author
Delete an author
Create a new book
Retrieve a list of all books
Retrieve a specific book by ID
Update a book
Delete a book

Each author should have the following properties:

- name
- bio

Each book should have the following properties:

- title
- description
- author
- published date


**Result**
# Author Routes

# Create a new author
@app.post("/authors/")
async def create_author():
    pass

# Retrieve a list of all authors
@app.get("/authors/")
async def get_authors():
    pass

# Retrieve a specific author by ID
@app.get("/authors/{author_id}")
async def get_author(author_id: int):
    pass

# Update an author
@app.put("/authors/{author_id}")
async def update_author(author_id: int):
    pass

# Delete an author
@app.delete("/authors/{author_id}")
async def delete_author(author_id: int):
    pass


# Book Routes

# Create a new book
@app.post("/books/")
async def create_book():
    pass

# Retrieve a list of all books
@app.get("/books/")
async def get_books():
    pass

# Retrieve a specific book by ID
@app.get("/books/{book_id}")
async def get_book(book_id: int):
    pass

# Update a book
@app.put("/books/{book_id}")
async def update_book(book_id: int):
    pass

# Delete a book
@app.delete("/books/{book_id}")
async def delete_book(book_id: int):
    pass
